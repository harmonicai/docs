title: Rate limits
description: Understand API rate limits and best practices
---

The Harmonic API allows a maximum of **10 requests per second**. Exceeding this limit returns a `429` HTTP response.

## Response headers

Every API response includes rate limit headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Ratelimit-Limit-Second` | Maximum number of requests allowed per second |
| `X-Ratelimit-Remaining-Second` | Remaining requests before the rate limit is reached |

### Example response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Ratelimit-Limit-Second: 10
X-Ratelimit-Remaining-Second: 5
```

## Best practices

- **Check rate limit headers** on each response to monitor your usage.
- **Implement exponential backoff** when you receive a `429` response.
- **Use batch endpoints** (like `POST /companies/batchGet`) to fetch multiple records in a single request instead of making individual calls.
- **Use the bulk dataset** if you need to make millions of requests. Contact [support@harmonic.ai](mailto:support@harmonic.ai) for details on Snowflake, S3, and BigQuery options.
