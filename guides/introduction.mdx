Welcome to the Harmonic API — the goal of these guides is to make using our API as easy and delightful as possible. If we haven't hit the mark, please consider sending us feedback at [support@harmonic.ai](mailto:support@harmonic.ai).

## Overview

The Harmonic API gives you programmatic access to our startup intelligence platform — an ever-growing database of 30M+ companies and 190M+ people. You can:

- **Enrich** companies and people by providing a URL or identifier
- **Search** for companies using saved searches or natural language
- **Fetch** detailed company and person profiles
- **Manage lists** of companies and people with custom fields
- **Access network data** to see your team's connections
- **Upload attachments** and manage custom global fields

## Base URL

All REST API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.harmonic.ai/
```

For GraphQL requests, use:

```
https://api.harmonic.ai/graphql
```

## GraphQL Explorer

We also offer a [GraphQL Explorer](/graphql/overview) that allows you to precisely define the fields in your response, reducing payload size and improving performance.

## Bulk data

If you plan to make a particularly large number of requests (in the millions), please let us know in advance. We offer a weekly-updated bulk dataset in data warehouses (Snowflake, S3, BigQuery). Reach out to [support@harmonic.ai](mailto:support@harmonic.ai) to learn more.
