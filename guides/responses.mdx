The Harmonic API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

## Status codes

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `200` | OK | Everything worked as expected. You have the latest data. |
| `201` | Enrichment Triggered | The entity exists and enrichment was triggered. Check back in a few hours for updated data. |
| `400` | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing required parameter. |
| `402` | Over Quota | You've exceeded your plan quota for this endpoint. |
| `403` | Forbidden | No valid API key provided, or the entity is private. Make sure to set any list or search to **Shared** before accessing via API. |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist. For enrich endpoints, this means enrichment was triggered. |
| `422` | Validation Error | A validation error occurred with the request parameters. |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded. See [Rate limits](/guides/rate-limits) for details. |
| `5XX` | Internal Server Error | An error occurred with the Harmonic API. Contact [support@harmonic.ai](mailto:support@harmonic.ai) if this persists. |

## Error handling

When you receive an error response, the response body typically includes a message describing the issue.

<Note>
For `201` and `404` responses on enrich endpoints, the entity may still be processing. Check back after a few hours for enriched data using the [Get enrichment status](/api-reference/enrich#get-enrichment-status) endpoint.
