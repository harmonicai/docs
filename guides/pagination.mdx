description: Navigate through large result sets using cursor-based pagination
---

Endpoints that may return a large number of results accept pagination parameters, allowing you to cycle through pages with a capped number of results.

## Cursor-based pagination

We recommend using cursor-based pagination, which offers better performance and usability.

### Request parameters

<ParamField query="size" type="integer" default="50">
  The number of results to return per page.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="cursor" type="string">
  Cursor indicating where to pick up results. Omit for the first page.
</ParamField>

### Response fields

The response includes a `page_info` object (or `pageInfo` in GraphQL):

<ResponseField name="page_info" type="object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="has_next" type="boolean">
      Whether there are more results available. In GraphQL, this field is `hasNext`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="cursor" type="string">
      The current cursor position.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="next" type="string">
      Token to pass as the `cursor` parameter in the next request.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example

First request (no cursor):

```bash
curl 'https://api.harmonic.ai/savedSearches:results/12345?size=50' \
  -H 'apikey: your_api_key'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "page_info": {
    "has_next": true,
    "cursor": "abc123",
    "next": "def456"
  }
}
```

Next page:

```bash
curl 'https://api.harmonic.ai/savedSearches:results/12345?size=50&cursor=def456' \
  -H 'apikey: your_api_key'
```

## Nested people

The nested `people` field within a company response contains at most 60 active employees, ordered by: founders, then executives, then employees — sorted from most to least tenured.

To paginate through all active employees of a company, use the [Get employees from company](/api-reference/fetch#get-employees-from-company) endpoint.
