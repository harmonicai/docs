description: Use GraphQL to precisely define the fields in your response
---

The Harmonic GraphQL API lets you request exactly the data you need, reducing response payload size and improving performance.

## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.harmonic.ai/graphql
```

## Authentication

Pass your API key via the `apikey` header, the same as the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.harmonic.ai/graphql' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'apikey: your_api_key' \
  -d '{"query": "{ company(id: 1) { name domain } }"}'
```

## GraphQL Explorer

The Harmonic Console includes an interactive GraphQL Explorer where you can build and test queries against the full schema. Access it at [console.harmonic.ai](https://console.harmonic.ai).

The explorer provides:

- **Auto-complete** for fields and types
- **Schema documentation** built into the sidebar
- **Query history** so you can revisit past queries

## Example queries

### Get a company profile

```graphql
query {
  company(id: 12345) {
    name
    domain
    description
    foundedDate
    headcount
    funding {
      totalFunding
      lastRoundDate
      lastRoundType
      lastRoundAmount
    }
  }
}
```

### Get a person profile

```graphql
query {
  person(id: 67890) {
    name
    linkedinUrl
    currentTitle
    currentCompany {
      name
      domain
    }
  }
}
```

### Paginate through search results

```graphql
query {
  savedSearchResults(urn: "urn:harmonic:saved_search:123", first: 50) {
    edges {
      node {
        name
        domain
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNext
      cursor
    }
  }
}
```

## GraphQL-only features

Some features are only available through GraphQL:

- **Financing / Deal Data** — Investor profiles, investments, and co-investors (paid add-on)
- **Network queries** — People and companies in your team's network
- **Watchlist updates** — Recent changes to people watchlist entries
- **Global field values** — Read custom global field values on companies and people

See the relevant API Reference sections for details on each.

## Pagination in GraphQL

GraphQL queries use cursor-based pagination with `first`/`after` parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `first` | Number of results to return |
| `after` | Cursor from the previous page's `pageInfo.cursor` |

The response includes a `pageInfo` object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hasNext` | Whether more results are available |
| `cursor` | Cursor for fetching the next page |

## Rate limits

The GraphQL endpoint shares the same [rate limits](/guides/rate-limits) as the REST API: 10 requests per second.
