Retrieve a single investor profile by URN. The response includes the investor's name, description, partners, investments, and co-investors.

Partners support cursor-based pagination (`first`/`after`). Investments and co-investors support offset-based pagination (`page`/`size`).

```graphql
query GetInvestor {
  getInvestorByUrn(urn: "urn:harmonic:investor:12345") {
    name
    description
    investmentsCount
    exitsCount
    partners(first: 10) {
      edges {
        node {
          name
          linkedinUrl
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
    investments(page: 0, size: 10) {
      company {
        name
        domain
      }
      roundDate
      roundType
    }
  }
}
